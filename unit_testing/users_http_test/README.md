Based on the information you've provided, I'll help you create a README update for your GitHub repository focusing on the users_http_test. This update will incorporate content from both articles you mentioned.

Here's a suggested README update:

## Users HTTP Test

This repository contains examples of unit testing in Flutter, specifically focusing on testing HTTP requests for a user application. The tests demonstrate how to use Mockito for mocking HTTP responses and testing asynchronous operations.

### Key Features

- Unit testing of HTTP requests in Flutter
- Mocking HTTP responses using Mockito
- Testing asynchronous operations
- Verifying correct data parsing and error handling

### Articles

For a detailed explanation of the concepts and implementation, please refer to these articles:

1. [HTTP User App](https://harishkunchala.com/unit-testing-in-flutter-with-examples#heading-example-2-http-user-app)
2. [Flutter Unit Testing with Mockito](https://harishkunchala.com/flutter-unit-testing-with-mockito)

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run build runner: `flutter pub add dev:mockito dev:build_runner`
4. Execute tests using `flutter test`

### Example Test

Here's a snippet of what you can expect in the tests:

```dart
void main() {
  group('fetchUser', () {
    test('returns a User if the http call completes successfully', () async {
      final client = MockClient();
      when(client
          .get(Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')))
          .thenAnswer((_) async =>
          http.Response('{"id": 1, "name": "Test User"}', 200));

      expect(await fetchUser(client), isA<User>());
    });

    test('throws an exception if the http call completes with an error', () {
      final client = MockClient();
      when(client
          .get(Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1')))
          .thenAnswer((_) async => http.Response('Not Found', 404));

      expect(fetchUser(client), throwsException);
    });
  });
}
```
